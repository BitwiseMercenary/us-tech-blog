It is a very exciting time for us at OpenTable, and specifically at OpenTable Engineering in Europe.

&#187; [Jump to the jobs](#engineering-managers)

I've been with OT for 10+ years and apart from one other significant project in 2015 we have always invested in and grown our teams steadily.  We have low churn and great career progression, so typically we look for new engineers just two or three times a year.

But in May of this year our executive team announced a significant strategic shift and focus on new lines of business, with accompanying investment in Engineering, Product and Design.  I was thrilled that our strong performance and culture in Europe was recognised, and many of these new roles are being filled in our European hubs in London (UK), Berlin (Germany) and Kaunas (Lithuania).

We're building three new teams; a **Hospitality** team (an offshoot from our existing Communications team), a **Payments** team (brand new greenfield work) and an **iOS** team (our first diner app team outside of California).

On Sunday we had a stand at Silicon Milkroundabout.  If you saw us I hope you got to speak to one of our engineers about our exciting projects and why OpenTable is a great place to work.  I'm always confident that you'll have a genuine and positive conversation with any of our team when talking about OT.

Finally, allow me to list out all the roles we are currently looking to fill and I hope you will take the time to read more and apply.  Thanks for reading.

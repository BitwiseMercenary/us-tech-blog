Tuesday the 12th of December, OpenTable is delighted to host the thirteenth appointment with the [WEBdeLDN](https://twitter.com/webdeldn) meetup.

To celebrate the end of the year, and welcome the new one with new and fresh ideas, we'll be listening to different speakers (many of them first-time speakers!) giving lightning talks about the most diverse topics: from personal stories to hardware projects, from 101s on computer science to accessibility and design.

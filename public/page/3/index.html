<p>We started off with just a couple of hapi.js apis. This was at a time when standing up new infrastructure was still a bit painful, so inevitably those apis ended up having more functionality in them than they should have. Now it’s easy for us to get infrastructure, so we want to do more of it.</p>
<p>Our goal is to have lots of small(er) apis that just look after one specific piece (skillfully avoiding using the buzzword ‘microservices’).</p>
<p>When you want to split out functionality from one api to another, it can be a pain, especially if you have a lot of consumers who aren’t particularly fast-moving or communicative. Or maybe you don’t know all your consumers up front.</p>
<p>You’ve got a couple of options here:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Maintain the functionality in two places and slowly migrate consumers across</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use a proxy or routing layer in-front of the api to rewrite or redirect requests</p>
</li>
<li><p>Write code in your api to proxy requests to a different server</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The first two options are pretty icky, and frankly the third isn’t all that great either. It all depends on you having the right framework. Do you see where I’m going here?</p>
<h3 id="Enter-Hapi-js"><a href="#Enter-Hapi-js" class="headerlink" title="Enter Hapi.js"></a>Enter Hapi.js</h3><p>Hapi.js has the concept of a ‘proxy’ handler, which can transparently proxy requests to a different server.</p>

It strongly mirrored my experience of moving into a leadership role and I’d recommend anyone with a spare 30mins to watch it.</p>
<p>Samantha’s talk made me reflect on how I struggle to coach talented individuals; how I can identify when it’s going wrong and what steps I can take to remedy the situation.</p>
<h2 id="Gold-star-syndrome"><a href="#Gold-star-syndrome" class="headerlink" title="Gold star syndrome"></a>Gold star syndrome</h2><p>A new concept for me and a recurring theme throughout the sessions at DareConf, ‘Gold Star Syndrome’ is a fixation on finding validation for your work. I feel this is a result of early childhood values spinning the perception of working life away from the actual reality. As a child, especially during our school years, we discovered that when we do good things, good things happen to us. Remember how it felt to get that gold star in your spelling test or that A+ on an English essay?</p>
<p>That was great in school and even through to University but working life is a much more terse environment and getting positive reenforcement is much less common. As professionals, the majority of our work goes unnoticed - until there is a problem or issue to solve. Then we feel open to the stinging criticism but resentful that months of good work went unnoticed.</p>
<p>When we continue to search for a gold star or continually strive for perfectionism we, as individuals, become much more insular and isolated. We tend to avoid showing our work until it is 100% ready and put up a shield to protect us from any feedback, in fear of being made to look stupid or being called a fraud.</p>
<h2 id="Empowerment"><a href="#Empowerment" class="headerlink" title="Empowerment"></a>Empowerment</h2><p>There is a considerable amount of <a href="http://whatworksforhealth.wisc.edu/program.php?t1=20&amp;t2=6&amp;t3=84&amp;id=311" target="_blank" rel="external">research</a> to suggest children who have bad experiences and manage to overcome them tend to grow up to become more rounded adults. By encouraging grit and allowing kids to solve their own problems, children learn they are empowered. They become more creative, more respectful, less dependant on others and display less problem behaviour.</p>
<p>This is also relatively easy to implement and can be as simple as involving children in a decision-making process. ‘What do you want to eat with dinner; carrots or broccoli’? This might progress to ‘What colour socks do you want to wear?’ or ‘Which swing do you want to play on?’</p>
<p>The concept of preventing yourself from controlling a situation is really key to successful coaching. Rescuing people by dictating an outcome  requires one weak person and one strong person. This propagates itself so people drift towards being a victim or a rescuer. A much better outcome would be a group of confident, empowered individuals who are able to work together.</p></div><a href="/blog/2014/10/31/coach-dont-rescue/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2014/10/22/hobknob-v1-dot-0-now-with-authorization/"><h2 class="post-title">Hobknob v1.0: Now with authorization</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 22 October 2014 · <a href="/blog/categories/Hobknob/" class="tag post-meta">Hobknob</a></p><div class="post-entry"><p>We are pleased to announce the version 1.0 release of <a href="https://github.com/opentable/hobknob" target="_blank" rel="external">Hobknob</a>, our open-source feature toggle management system. With it comes a few additions and several improvements. </p>
<p>This post will expand on some of the changes, in particular, authorisation via access control lists.<br>For an introduction to Hobknob, see our previous post: <a href="/blog/2014/09/04/introducing-hobknob-feature-toggling-with-etcd/">Introducing Hobknob: Feature toggling with etcd</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Authorisation-with-ACLs"><a href="#Authorisation-with-ACLs" class="headerlink" title="Authorisation with ACLs"></a>Authorisation with ACLs</h2><p>A much requested feature was the ability to control who can add/update/delete toggles on an application by application basis. We achieve this via the use if an Access Control List for each application. Users that are part of the ACL for an application are known as application owners.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/hobknob-owners.png" alt="Hobknob Owner List"></p>
<p>Application owners can (for an owned application):</p>
<ul>
<li>Add toggles</li>
<li>Set the value of a toggle</li>
<li>Delete toggles</li>
<li>Add additional owners</li>
<li>Remove owners</li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add an application</li>
<li>See toggles</li>
<li>See application owners</li>
<li>See the audit trail for a toggle</li>
</ul>
<p>When a user creates an new application, they are automatically added as an owner for that application.<br>The user can then add other application owners by clicking the ‘Add user’ button in the Owners panel and entering the users email address.</p></div><a href="/blog/2014/10/22/hobknob-v1-dot-0-now-with-authorization/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2014/10/06/puppetconf-2014-part-3/"><h2 class="post-title">PuppetConf 2014 - Part 3</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 6 October 2014 · <a href="/blog/categories/Puppet/" class="tag post-meta">Puppet</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Conferences/" class="tag post-meta">Conferences</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/PuppetConf-2014/" class="tag post-meta">PuppetConf 2014</a></p><div class="post-entry"><h2 id="Day-2"><a href="#Day-2" class="headerlink" title="Day 2"></a>Day 2</h2><p>This is our summary of PuppetConf 2014.

<p>There were even more inspiring keynotes and lots more talks which have given us plenty of ideas to go home and think about.</p>

<p>Dan Spuring, VP of Tech Services at Getty came out of the gate with a strong message. His <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=GSD" target="_blank" rel="external">GSD</a> t-shirt<br>giving you a clear understanding of who he is. His talk about creating a culture of Puppet adoption at his company was a great story of how challenging it<br>can be to move various business units with projects of various ages to a configuration-management (with Puppet) ethos.</p>
<p>I think it is good to hear that they are rolling cm out into that huge backlog of legacy infrastructure that we all try to pretend isn’t there.<br>How do you make it integrate into existing processes? How do you sell the DevOps message at the same time as introducing a tool like Puppet into the mix as<br>part of that message? Dan gave some thoughts on this and it was good to hear some of that from someone who appears to be on the other side of that challenge.</p>
<p>One of the analogies that he used I that found quite useful was that undertaking a project like this is like moving a boulder. It requires an executive sponsor to<br>get the thing moving at all and then it requires everyone pulling in the same direction if it’s ever doing to get anywhere.</p>
<p>The big take-away was that you need to puppetize right away - that you can’t wait for the right environment or conditions to start doing it, you just need<br>start now and demonstrate it. This echo’s the Continuous Delivery ideal of “if it hurts, then do it more often”.</p></div><a href="/blog/2014/10/06/puppetconf-2014-part-3/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2014/10/06/puppetconf-2014-part-2/"><h2 class="post-title">PuppetConf 2014 - Part 2</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 6 October 2014 · <a href="/blog/categories/Puppet/" class="tag post-meta">Puppet</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Conferences/" class="tag post-meta">Conferences</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/PuppetConf-2014/" class="tag post-meta">PuppetConf 2014</a></p><div class="post-entry"><h2 id="Day-1"><a href="#Day-1" class="headerlink" title="Day 1"></a>Day 1</h2><p>This is our summary of PuppetConf 2014.

<p>The big keynote of the event to kick off the first day from the author of Puppet himself. This was obviously going to be a tweet worthy affair full of photos<br>and big announcements and it did not disappoint.</p>
<p>Native Clients (CFactor + C++ rewrite of agents) are coming in the very near future. This is not only a matter of improving the performance for existing users part<br>of philosophy of PuppetLabs to become ubiquitous across as many devices and platforms as possible. This is one of those improvements that is really setting up<br>PuppetLabs for the future.</p>
<p>Puppet Server (a.k.a the Clojure rewrite). This is PuppetLabs big move away from Ruby on onto the JVM. Being on the JVM means they can slowly rewrite the<br>codebase while also maintaining compatibility thanks to JRuby. They have gained a lot of experience with Clojure thanks to the PuppetDB &amp; TrapKeeper projects and given how<br>successful that project has been it has helped ease many of the fears people have in moving the JVM. Puppet Server is also a self contained application so there<br>is no longer any need to worry about the whole apache/passanger yak shave. There was even a demo on the metrics that are now exposed by Puppet Server - yes<br>you can now plug Puppet into graphite.</p>

<p>It has been one week since our attendance at this years PuppetConf and we have just now caught up on all the great talks that were<br>given and the projects demonstrated over the 3 day period. Here’s our summary of the event (split into 3 parts), hopefully you will<br>find as much inspiration in the content as we have.</p>
<h2 id="Day-0-Contributor-Summit"><a href="#Day-0-Contributor-Summit" class="headerlink" title="Day 0 - Contributor Summit"></a>Day 0 - Contributor Summit</h2><p>For the first time, this years Puppet Contributor Summit was held the day prior to the conference itself and I think this was a great idea.<br>Most of the Puppetlabs staff and many of the high profile community members were in town for PuppetConf anyway so it made sense. There was<br>roughly 60-70 people in attendance both senior contributors and people new to the community so it was a great mix that led to some<br>fantastic discussions.</p>
<p>The day itself had two tracks: a module track for forge modules and a core track for people contributing to puppet and factor.</p>
<p>Those of you who have seen our <a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/opentable" target="_blank" rel="external">forge module page</a> will understand why we chose to stay in the module track.<br>Although I heard there were many great discussions to be had with regards to Puppet 4 in the core track.</p>
<p>Each track was split into three sections: a brief introduction from the track lead Ryan Coleman (<a href="https://twitter.com/ryanycoleman" target="_blank" rel="external">@ryanycoleman</a>),<br>followed by some lighting talks and then several hours of hacking and open discussions.</p>
<h3 id="Lightning-Talks"><a href="#Lightning-Talks" class="headerlink" title="Lightning Talks:"></a>Lightning Talks:</h3><p>Here is a quick overview of the lightening talks from the module track:</p>

Whether you are trialing a new feature or using branch by abstraction to avoid creating feature branches, the use of feature toggles can aid continuous delivery and provide a mechanism to reduce mean time to resolution when an issue occurs.</p>
<p>With a relatively large engineering department with multiple teams spread across the US and UK the need to manage feature toggles has evolved to the point whereby individual teams have developed their own implementations. Most of these are simple config files.</p>
<p>We decided to unify this effort by providing a central place to store feature toggles, provide a dashboard to be able to turn these toggles on/off and provide language specific clients to integrate into our software components.</p>
<p>The results of this was <a href="https://github.com/opentable/hobknob" target="_blank" rel="external">Hobknob</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Why-etcd"><a href="#Why-etcd" class="headerlink" title="Why etcd?"></a>Why etcd?</h2><p>We made the decision to use <a href="https://github.com/coreos/etcd" target="_blank" rel="external">etcd</a>. Etcd is “a highly-available key value store for shared configuration” (<a href="https://github.com/coreos/etcd#etcd" target="_blank" rel="external">https://github.com/coreos/etcd#etcd</a>). It provides a HTTP API to store and retrieve data. This is what makes it perfect for a feature toggling solution used by multiple components. It means that we didn’t have to write an intermediate API on top of a data store for consumers.</p>
<p>So, for example, to store a feature toggle in etcd:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">curl -L http://127.0.0.1:4001/v2/keys/v1/toggles/restaurant-api/testtoggle -XPUT -d value=&quot;true&quot;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>To retrieve a feature toggle:</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">curl -L http://127.0.0.1:4001/v2/keys/v1/toggles/restaurant-api/testtoggle</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></div><a href="/blog/2014/09/04/introducing-hobknob-feature-toggling-with-etcd/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2014/09/01/testing-puppet-with-beaker-pt-dot-3-testing-roles/"><h2 class="post-title">Testing Puppet with Beaker pt.3 - Testing Roles</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 1 September 2014</p><div class="post-entry"><p>In the first two parts of this blog series we have focusing on testing puppet <em>modules</em> with beaker. As an open source contributor there is always<br>a large test matrix so this makes absolute sense. But what about the other large use-case for beaker - what about our day-to-day internal code base?<br>Not all of this is modules, in fact a large portion of it is other puppet code - roles, profiles, facts, hiera data etc. All of this needs testing<br>as well.</p>
<p>In this blog post I will be showing how we have started using beaker to test our puppet roles and profiles for both Linux and Windows.</p>
<h2 id="Master-vs-Masterless"><a href="#Master-vs-Masterless" class="headerlink" title="Master-vs-Masterless"></a>Master-vs-Masterless</h2><p>Prior to this post all our beaker testing has been master-less i.e. using using puppet agent apply. This is perfectly adequate for most use cases when<br>testing modules in isolation but doesn’t always work when testing an internal code base (unless you are masterless there as well then please skip to the next section).</p>
<p>At OpenTable we do use a central puppet master to compile our catalogs. So when testing our puppet roles we wanted to make sure that we were also testing<br>with a master-agent configuration. It is worth mentioning here that if (like us) you are testing windows agents then you are going to need to test with master-agent<br>approach due to the lack of a windows master.</p>
<p>Testing the master-agent configuration means configuring multi-node sets in beaker. There are not many examples of this but the principle is very much<br>the same as the single-node nodeset. Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code>HOSTS:
  ubuntu-server-12042-x64-master:
    roles:
      - master
    platform: ubuntu-12.04-amd64
    box: ubuntu-server-12042-x64-vbox4210-nocm
    box_url: http://puppet-vagrant-boxes.puppetlabs.com/ubuntu-server-12042-x64-vbox4210-nocm.box
    hypervisor: vagrant
    ip: &apos;10.255.33.135&apos;
  win-2008R2-std:
    roles:
      - default
      - agent
    platform: windows-server-amd64
    box: opentable/win-2008r2-standard-amd64-nocm
    box_version: = 1.0.0
    box_check_update: false
    hypervisor: vagrant
    user: vagrant
    ip: &apos;10.255.33.129&apos;
    communicator: bitvise
CONFIG:
  log_level: verbose
  type: git
</code></pre><p>In this example you will see that we are specifying different ‘roles’ for each host in the nodeset. What a role is in in this context is a tag for that node that allows<br>us to reference it directly later when running commands on the host. To avoid any further confusion, from this point onwards if I am referring to the role defined in the<br>nodeset file I will call it the ‘nodeset role’ otherwise I am referring the the puppet role provided in the manifest. There are a couple of build-in nodeset roles that<br>Beaker already knows about: master, agent and default. The first two are pretty self explanatory but the last nodeset role - default - is the location where the tests<br>themselves run. In you don’t specify the ‘default’ nodeset role on any of your host definitions then the tests will run on the first host that you specified in in the<br>nodeset file (which in the case of the example above would be wrong).</p>
<p>You may have a more complicated configuration that you wish to test and this allows you to specify arbitrary tags which can be very useful.</p>
<p>We can now use these nodeset roles to configure our master and agent.</p></div><a href="/blog/2014/09/01/testing-puppet-with-beaker-pt-dot-3-testing-roles/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article></div><ul class="pager main-pager"><li class="previous"><a href="/page/2">← Newer Posts</a></li><li class="next"><a href="/page/4">Older Posts →</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class="container beautiful-jekyll-footer"><div class="row"><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href="https://github.com/opentable" title="GitHub"><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-stack-1x fa-inverse fa-github"></i></span></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/opentabletechuk" title="Twitter"><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-stack-1x fa-inverse fa-twitter"></i></span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/12181" title="LinkedIn"><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-stack-1x fa-inverse fa-linkedin"></i></span></a></li><li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/companies/opentable" title="StackOverflow"><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-stack-1x fa-inverse fa-stack-overflow"></i></span></a></li></ul><p class="copyright text-muted">© OpenTable • 2017 • <a href="mailto:undefined"></a>

As an open source contributor there is always<br>a large test matrix so this makes absolute sense. But what about the other large use-case for beaker - what about our day-to-day internal code base?<br>Not all of this is modules, in fact a large portion of it is other puppet code - roles, profiles, facts, hiera data etc. All of this needs testing<br>as well.</p>
<p>In this blog post I will be showing how we have started using beaker to test our puppet roles and profiles for both Linux and Windows.</p>
<h2 id="Master-vs-Masterless"><a href="#Master-vs-Masterless" class="headerlink" title="Master-vs-Masterless"></a>Master-vs-Masterless</h2><p>Prior to this post all our beaker testing has been master-less i.e. using using puppet agent apply. This is perfectly adequate for most use cases when<br>testing modules in isolation but doesn’t always work when testing an internal code base (unless you are masterless there as well then please skip to the next section).</p>
<p>At OpenTable we do use a central puppet master to compile our catalogs. So when testing our puppet roles we wanted to make sure that we were also testing<br>with a master-agent configuration. It is worth mentioning here that if (like us) you are testing windows agents then you are going to need to test with master-agent<br>approach due to the lack of a windows master.</p>
<p>Testing the master-agent configuration means configuring multi-node sets in beaker. There are not many examples of this but the principle is very much<br>the same as the single-node nodeset. Here is an example:</p></div><a href="/blog/2014/09/01/testing-puppet-with-beaker-pt-dot-3-testing-roles/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2014/09/01/testing-puppet-with-beaker-pt-dot-2-the-windows-story/"><h2 class="post-title">Testing Puppet with Beaker pt.2 - The Windows story</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 1 September 2014 · <a href="/blog/categories/Acceptance-tests/" class="tag post-meta">Acceptance tests</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Puppet/" class="tag post-meta">Puppet</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Vagrant/" class="tag post-meta">Vagrant</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Windows/" class="tag post-meta">Windows</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Beaker/" class="tag post-meta">Beaker</a></p><div class="post-entry"><p>In <a href="/blog/2014/04/04/testing-puppet-with-beaker/">part one</a> we discussed our first steps into the world of acceptance testing our Puppet manifests.<br>By using Beaker we able to test managing local users on our Linux boxes. This was a positive experience for us. It allowed us to get to grips with the basics of configuring<br>Beaker to run tests and configuring our node sets to run those tests against. In this post, we will be discussing how we went about getting Beaker working with Windows.</p>
<p>As many of your reading this will be aware, OpenTable currently has quite a large Windows infrastructure and we are using Puppet extensively to maintain that environment.<br>We are also moving forward with releasing as many of our modules open source onto the <a href="https://forge.puppetlabs.com/opentable" target="_blank" rel="external">Puppet Forge</a> as possible (11 out of 18 of which are Windows<br>exclusive). What this means is that there was no way that we could ignore trying to use Beaker to test our manifests against Windows. We knew that we would have to support<br>many different versions and editions of Windows out there in the community as well that the ones we have to support internally.</p>
<p>This was going to be a challenge (configuration management with Windows usually is) but we were up for it.</p>
<p>##The Preliminaries</p>
<p>###Serverspec<br>The first step was looking at Serverspec. Serverspec is a Ruby gem that provides extensions to RSpec that allow you to test the actual state of your servers, either locally<br>or from the outside in via SSH. What we needed to know was did it support Windows? The answer was thankfully a resounding “Yes!”. All the <a href="http://serverspec.org/resource_types.html" target="_blank" rel="external">resource types</a> that you might want to test including file, service and user are available and supported on Windows. There are also a couple of Windows specific ones such as iis_website, Windows_feature and Windows_registry_key. We even added our own to support <a href="https://github.com/serverspec/serverspec/pull/403/files" target="_blank" rel="external">Windows_scheduled_task</a>. Interestingly Serverspec also supports WinRM as an alternative to SSH when you are testing from the outside-in but we will go back into that later. As long as your using Serverspec &gt; 1.6 you will have all the Windows support you might need.</p>

<p>In <a href="/blog/2014/04/16/look-ma-no-unit-tests">a recent post</a>, I espoused some of the benefits my team enjoyed by reducing our test-base to a single layer of acceptance tests, with no separate unit or integration tests. It caused <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/237fr1/look_ma_no_unit_tests/" target="_blank" rel="external">some minor controversy</a>, which was not to be unexpected. At the time, I knew I had left out some details for brevity’s sake. In this post—spurred on by some interesting <a href="https://twitter.com/NathanGloyn/status/456756552092098561" target="_blank" rel="external">questions</a> and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/237fr1/look_ma_no_unit_tests/cgujuv7" target="_blank" rel="external">commentary</a>—I’d like to offer a more constructive view on the subject, and dig a little deeper into the nitty gritty of how we made it work.</p>
<p>I’ll also point out some other hidden benefits of moving to acceptance-only testing, and suggest synergistic practices that can help decide if this is the right approach for your project.</p>
<h2 id="Seams"><a href="#Seams" class="headerlink" title="Seams"></a>Seams</h2><p>After-the-fact unit testing requires us to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEhu57pih5w" target="_blank" rel="external">find the seams</a> along which code can be isolated and tested. Where those seams don’t exist,  the temptation is to refactor code until they do, using patterns like <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html" target="_blank" rel="external">dependency injection</a>, and following <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle" target="_blank" rel="external">SRP</a> and other <a href="http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod" target="_blank" rel="external">SOLID</a> patterns.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development" target="_blank" rel="external">Test-first unit testing</a> aka TDD naturally tends to maximise seams, and results in highly decoupled code with small, specific tests. TDD must result in 100% unit test coverage, if practiced according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-Driven_Development_by_Example" target="_blank" rel="external">the gospel</a>. In other words, TDD results in the best kind of code for later <a href="http://sourcemaking.com/refactoring" target="_blank" rel="external">modification without risk</a>, and the best tests for detailed, granular feedback. Unit tests also tend to run very quickly, sometimes fast enough to <a href="http://misko.hevery.com/2009/05/07/configure-your-ide-to-run-your-tests-automatically/" target="_blank" rel="external">run every time you hit “Save”</a>.</p></div><a href="/blog/2014/05/20/acceptance-now/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2014/05/19/continuous-delivery-automating-deployment-visibility/"><h2 class="post-title">Continuous Delivery: Automating Deployment Visibility</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 19 May 2014 · <a href="/blog/categories/Continuous-delivery/" class="tag post-meta">Continuous delivery</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Hubot/" class="tag post-meta">Hubot</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Hipchat/" class="tag post-meta">Hipchat</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Chatops/" class="tag post-meta">Chatops</a></p><div class="post-entry"><p>In our continued effort to drive towards a service oriented architecture each of our teams are continuously improving their deployment processes.

This included our application configuration stack. IIS management is pretty easy with PowerShell. It would look something like this</p>
<pre><code>Import-Module WebAdministration
New-WebSite -Name &quot;DemoSite&quot; -Port 80 -IP * -PhysicalPath &quot;c:\inetpub\wwwroot&quot; -ApplicationPool &quot;MyAppPool&quot;
</code></pre><p>This would of course set up a website called ‘DemoSite’ running on port 80 on the local machine. The cmdlets that come with PowerShell make this pretty easy. This is great if it is a one-off job to set up a site. We run our websites from a number of webservers, therefore, it would be silly to have to RDP into each webserver and run a script on it. This is why tools like Puppet, Chef, Ansible etc. exist. We needed a configuration management tool to do this work for us. It has a number of benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Orchestration</li>
<li>Idempotency</li>
<li>Makes sure that each server is configured in ‘exactly’ the same way as no human intervention is needed</li>
<li>Developers can help the operations team by creating the scripts needed. This is great for collaboration between teams</li>
</ul>
<p>On investigating how we would do this with Puppet, we noticed that there were not many other people managing their site in this way. Therefore, we would have to turn our PowerShell scripts into Puppet modules to manage our system. </p>
<p>We have since created a Puppet module to manage IIS.

<h2 id="The-deal"><a href="#The-deal" class="headerlink" title="The deal"></a>The deal</h2><p>I started as an on-site engineer and subsequently became a remote worker and my challenge was to make remote working as similar to on-site working as possible. Thus it is natural that <strong>I work the same working hours</strong> as my colleagues in the office (despite the time difference) and I take <strong>public holidays</strong> at the same time that there are bank holidays in UK (even though in Poland they are different).</p>
<p>We also decided that every two months I will <strong>visit the office for a week</strong> as well as arranging visits to coincide with other office guests (like contractors, overseas colleagues and so on). All this is to try to keep me as close to the team as possible and disrupt the normal work-flow as little as possible.</p>

<p>At OpenTable we strive to deliver change as quickly and correctly as possible. To do this effectively we are always looking for <a href="/blog/2014/02/28/api-benchmark/">new</a> <a href="/blog/2013/08/16/grunt-plus-vagrant-equals-acceptance-test-heaven/">tools</a> <a href="/blog/2014/04/07/upgrading-puppet-with-puppet/">and</a> <a href="/blog/2014/02/10/the-adoption-of-configuration-management/">methods</a> that allow us, the developers, to respond quickly and accurately to changing requirements and environments.</p>
<p>There are a number of practices that we already make use of, helping us to be the most effective team I’ve ever worked in:</p>
<ul>
<li>We operate in small teams who each own <em>most</em> of their own vertical.</li>
<li>We use continuous delivery to ship code to production within minutes.</li>
<li>We have a high degree of high-quality test coverage.</li>
<li>We are getting better and better at monitoring All The Things.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/2013/11/22/beginning-a-journey-to-chatops-with-hubot/">We use Chatops</a>, so communication is central to our work, and keeps remote workers/teams in the loop.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the above are truly empowering for the dev team, and are conducive to an amazingly stress-free working environment. However, these practices only address the infrastructure, culture, and ceremony surrounding our work. What if there was something else? Something about the way we write the code itself, that could increase our velocity yet further, without compromising our integrity…</p>

<p>We are fortunate enough to be in an industry that gives us the chance to coach others and have a direct influence on the learning of individuals around us. But how do we know when we’re doing it right, or more importantly what can we do when it starts to go wrong?</p>

<p>The first recognised attempt to identify different approaches individuals use in order to learn was David Kolb with the book ‘<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Experiential-Learning-Experience-Source-Development/dp/0132952610" target="_blank" rel="external">Experimental Learning</a>‘. Kolb suggested that humans have a range of learning techniques available to us and that we tend to lean on one learning style above all others.</p>
<p>In recent times his research has proved to be inaccurate - yes people have different learning styles, yes they  show an emphasis in one particular style but Kolb’s definition of separate styles was confused. </p></div><a href="/blog/2014/02/03/coaching-style-over-substance/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2013/11/22/beginning-a-journey-to-chatops-with-hubot/"><h2 class="post-title">Beginning a journey to chatops with Hubot</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 22 November 2013 · <a href="/blog/categories/Hubot/" class="tag post-meta">Hubot</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Hipchat/" class="tag post-meta">Hipchat</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Chatops/" class="tag post-meta">Chatops</a></p><div class="post-entry"><img src="/images/posts/hubot_pug_me.png" class="center">
<p>As a part of our 30% time a few of our team, <a href="https://twitter.com/ajroyle" target="_blank" rel="external">@ajroyle</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/stack72" target="_blank" rel="external">@stack72</a> and I (<a href="https://twitter.com/ryantomlinson" target="_blank" rel="external">@ryantomlinson</a>) decided to get together and look at <a href="http://hubot.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Hubot</a> with <a href="https://www.hipchat.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Hipchat</a> integration. There are several weird and wonderful scripts that ship with Hubot (see above) but the core concept of driving tooling via chat is one that we see value in.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-Chatops"><a href="#What-is-Chatops" class="headerlink" title="What is Chatops?"></a>What is Chatops?</h2><p><a href="https://speakerdeck.com/jnewland/chatops-at-github" target="_blank" rel="external">Chatops</a> is a term coined by Github to describe their growing culture of “putting tools in the middle of the conversation”. But what does that exactly mean?</p>
<p>To move fast and maintain stability it’s important to have a culture of automation, measurement and sharing (<a href="http://www.opscode.com/blog/2010/07/16/what-devops-means-to-me/" target="_blank" rel="external">CAMS</a>). Tooling plays a key role in doing so and as your devops toolkit grows with the team there is an inherent learning and maintenance overhead. <a href="http://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Github</a> made a move to centralise the conversation by driving everything they do into chat. By building tools and executing commands in a chat room that can be automated by a bot, communication doesn’t become an afterthought to operational processes but is core to how you operate. If I want to deploy code, I type a command into chat. If I want to take a server offline, I type a command into chat. If I want to merge a git pull request into master, I type in a command into chat, and so on. Communication is baked in.</p>

I wanted to be able to extend this functionality. I wanted to allow different domains to point to different areas. This would allow me to deploy the application just once and then have different headers on the web server rather than regional variances. Whilst on a flight to San Francisco, I was able to hack together some code that allows just that. The details of that hackiness are below.</p>
<p>I started with a simple ASP.NET MVC application. I then created an area. The default area registration looks as follows:</p>
<pre><code>public class Domain1AreaRegistration: AreaRegistration   
{
    public override void RegisterArea(AreaRegistrationContext context)
    {
        context.MapRoute(
            &quot;Domain_1_default&quot;,
            &quot;Domain1/{controller}/{action}/{id}&quot;,
            new { controller = &quot;Home&quot;, action = &quot;Index&quot;, id = UrlParameter.Optional },
            new[] { &quot;WebApplication.Controllers&quot; }
        );
    }

    public override string AreaName
    {
        get { return &quot;Domain1&quot;; }
    }
}
</code></pre><p>The name of the folder in my project corresponds to the AreaName as above. I have approximately six areas in the application that relate to different views. Now is where the hacky magic happens. I build the routing for the application myself. In my global.asax.cs, I have the following declaration:</p>
<pre><code>protected void Application_Start()
{
    AreaRegistration.RegisterAllAreas();

    //this is done using my IoC container
    var routingEngine = new RoutingEngineFactory();
    routingEngine.RoutingRegistration(RouteTable.Routes);
}
</code></pre><p>This is the creation of my RoutingEngine. This class is responsible for taking each area in the system in turn and then creating the routes for my application based on these. I am sure you are asking why I am doing that? The answer is simply that I can use a combination of MapRoute and IRouteConstraints to build a sufficient route for the URLs I need to map. The code looks as follows:</p>

<p>In our NeverEnding quest to provide better experience to the users we utilise user behaviour logs to influence future results. One particular case is restaurant popularity, which is indicated by many factors, for example how often it is searched and viewed.</p>
<p>In this blog post we will look into multiple ways of counting documents in Elastic Search which is crucial for this kind of activity. All examples here are provided using Elastic Search HTTP interface and code examples implemented with <a href="https://github.com/Yegoroff/PlainElastic.Net" target="_blank" rel="external">PlainElastic.NET</a> are <a href="https://gist.github.com/gondar/6320578" target="_blank" rel="external">available here</a></p>

<p>I’m not going to bang on about how great Vagrant is, because better people than me have already soliloquised at length on that subject. Let’s just take it as writ that <strong>Vagrant is awesome</strong>. </p>
<p>The objective is simple, we want to have a virtualised environment to run our acceptance tests against, that we can create and provision on demand, to ensure that our acceptance tests only deal with functional-correctness, not data- or environment-correctness.</p>
<p>I created a set of Grunt tasks which were able to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spin up an provision a Vagrant instance</li>
<li>Deploy the project code    </li>
<li>Start the server</li>
<li>Run the acceptance tests</li>
<li>Tear it all down</li>

It lints, it configures, it minifies, it tests and it packages.</p>
<p>As we move towards getting our first node app into production, we were looking at ways to deploy it. First we thought of <a href="http://www.capistranorb.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Capistrano</a>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Capistrano</em></strong> is a fully featured deployment framework written in ruby and levering rake style tasks. It’s extremely powerful and very robust, plus there is a <a href="https://github.com/loopj/capistrano-node-deploy" target="_blank" rel="external">gem for node deployments</a>. Alas, it was not to be. After half a day of tail chasing and hoop jumping, it occurred to me that there must be an easier way. Capistrano was encouraging me to make my project fit their template, rather than allowing me to configure the deployment to match my project. When I dug down into the Capistrano source, I found that it was just using ssh and sftp to run remote commands and copy files. But we can simplify this process.</p>
<p><strong><em>Grunt</em></strong> has been great so far, so I started looking at deploying directly through grunt. We would be deploying to Ubuntu server boxes, so the only tools necessary are ssh and sftp.</p>
<p>There are Grunt modules for nearly <a href="https://npmjs.org/search?q=grunt" target="_blank" rel="external">everything</a> (linting, minifying, testing, waiting, packaging, shell-exec’ing, tagging, etc.), and rather predictably, sshing (with sftp).</p>

Thankfully, at the time, all the data I needed was cached in memory so building the response object was a simple set of linq queries over the cached reviews.</p>
<h2 id="The-problem"><a href="#The-problem" class="headerlink" title="The problem"></a>The problem</h2><p>Over time the number of reviews grow, and grow, and grow!  In fact it is inevitable that, in time, it will reach a point where caching all this data in memory would be madness.  One option to mitigate this would be to limit the cache to a fixed date range but this won’t work in this instance because the summary logic supports custom date ranges.  Another option would be to pull the data from the persistence store each and every time it’s required however this would seriously impact load on the infrastructure and degrade performance of the API.</p>
<p>We like to be proactive at OpenTable, so during innovation time (yes! we get time to innovate on our development) I looked at finding an alternate solution that would meet the requirements of the logic and wouldn’t drastically increase load or degrade performance.</p>
<h2 id="The-solution"><a href="#The-solution" class="headerlink" title="The solution"></a>The solution</h2><p>MongoDB supports <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce" target="_blank" rel="external">MapReduce</a> which allows processing large volumes of data (Map), running arbitrary logic to summarise (Reduce) and producing some results.  In MongoDB the MapReduce functionality uses JavaScript functions to perform the map and reduce steps and the syntax is relatively simple to understand:-</p>

This essentially means that regardless what the developers’ machine is set up or running as, they can still reproduce the same environment as their colleagues just by entering a command. </p>
<p>Configuration managgement is something we have had to embrace to help us maintain an ever changing world of technologies. The hardest thing is knowing what we actually have to build in these environments. We use Vagrant to help us understand this. The simple flow is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developer starts a new project</li>
<li>Developer creates a Vagrantfile to spin up a local VM</li>
<li>Vagrantfile gets iterated on as the development process goes forward</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the developer understands what they need to actually run their software, we would then go about creating an environment to which this software will actually be deployed for end-to-end testing. I won’t go any further into the details of our Vagrant flow in this post, if you want to read more about how to get started with Vagrant, then I would suggest reading <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920026358.do" target="_blank" rel="external">Vagrant Up and Running</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/mitchellh" target="_blank" rel="external">Mitchell Hashimoto</a>.</p>

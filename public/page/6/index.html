One of the projects my team is responsible for is a REST API that provides UI elements for HTML5 applications, shaped as HTML snippets and static resources. Our consumers are websites deployed in multiple parts of the world, so our service needs to be fast and reliable.</p>
<h2 id="The-why"><a href="#The-why" class="headerlink" title="The why"></a>The why</h2><p>A couple of weeks after joining the company I decided, as part of my <a href="/blog/2014/02/06/20-percent-time/">innovation time</a>, to rebuild the core of a .NET WebApi project in node.js in order to have a working prototype that could do exactly the same job as the original one, and could help me to observe how the two applications could react with similar volumes of traffic. After managing to make the two apis run on two clean VMs with the same configuration, I wrote a little node.js script to start performing some requests and test the response times. After seeing the results I thought that something was going wrong:</p>

<p>After trying to microbenchmark different layers of the software, I found the problem. On the .NET side I was reading a file synchronously, for every request; the file system’s library used with the node.js app, instead, was automatically caching the reads as default. After setting up a basic caching mechanism in the .NET app and running my script again the node.js API was only 1.4 times faster. After finding and solving that issue I thought how badly the application could have handled concurrency when deployed in production, even if it was heavily unit tested, the specs were well defined, and it was built using all the best techniques we all love.</p>
<p>As developers we rely on technologies that, with a minimum effort, can guarantee some pretty decent results in terms of performance. Modern web frameworks handle concurrency and thread management without requiring much plumbing code. Sophisticated and relatively cheap cloud services help us monitor our applications, providing dashboards, reports and alerting systems. Deploying on the cloud we can run our services and even auto-scale them depending on how much power we need. Even with these tools we must still own the responsibility of writing good quality code, testing it properly, and deploying as fast as possible in order to optimise the delivery process of our products. </p>
<p>But what about performance? I mean, what about the relationship between the code we write every day, and the way we impact overall performance? Are we sure that we are not deploying to production something that is degrading our services’ performance?</p>
<h2 id="The-how"><a href="#The-how" class="headerlink" title="The how"></a>The how</h2><p>Talking about the ‘why’ could be relatively easy, but the ‘how’ is a controversial topic. In my experience there are three important steps to any dish. First, we need the right tools to manipulate the ingredients. I tried many different tools but I couldn’t find a good fit for all my benchmarking requirements. It always makes sense to start with something to get you going but after a while it is important to find what’s the best for you, your team, and your project.</p>
<p>Then, you start cooking: personally, the number of things I’ve learned by just starting to benchmark some services is incredible. Nevertheless, as with every time we talk about metrics, it is key to know what is important about the data we are analysing, recognise the false positives/negatives and be aware of vanity metrics that could emphasize something irrelevant, or, more importantly, hide something significant.</p></div><a href="/blog/2014/02/28/api-benchmark/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2014/02/12/programme-management/"><h2 class="post-title">Programme Management, making Agile scale</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 12 February 2014 · <a href="/blog/categories/Leadership/" class="tag post-meta">Leadership</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Conferences/" class="tag post-meta">Conferences</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Agile/" class="tag post-meta">Agile</a></p><div class="post-entry"></div><a href="/blog/2014/02/12/programme-management/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2014/02/10/the-adoption-of-configuration-management/"><h2 class="post-title">The adoption of Configuration Management</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 10 February 2014 · <a href="/blog/categories/Puppet/" class="tag post-meta">Puppet</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/DevOps/" class="tag post-meta">DevOps</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Configuration-management/" class="tag post-meta">Configuration management</a></p><div class="post-entry"><p>In years gone by, we were a traditional IT company. We had teams of developers and operations. They rarely mixed. Around nine months ago we started to really try and get these teams working together. We introduced a configuration management tool, <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/puppet/what-is-puppet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Puppet</a>, into our ecosystem. </p>
<p>Configuration management is one of the steps of continuous delivery that developers often forget. They feel that systems are magically created for them to deploy their application to. I used to believe this. When I was focused on developing software, I never gave any thought as to the work our operations team had to do to keep the train on the track. So give some respect to your operations teams! We created a repository and started to experiment by configuring some of our applications using Puppet. </p>
<p>This was a major step for both sets of teams. The developers started being in charge of the configuration of their application. This meant that their application would guarantee to be configured the same in our CI environment as it was in production. We, as developers, would be more confident of our applications working as expected. </p>
<p>To contribute to the project, as an engineer, you need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>fork the project</li>
<li>make the changes you require</li>
<li>test the changes in a Vagrant environment (already created with a Windows and Linux system)</li>
<li>send a PR (pull request)</li>
</ul>
<p>We have just merged our #847 pull request. The stats of the repository look as follows:</p>
<img src="/images/posts/puppet-adoption.png" class="center">
<p>Our puppet repository has had contributions from over 40% of our engineering / operations teams. We use Puppet to manage our application servers, DHCP servers, provisioning systems and even our MS Sql Server continuous integration infrastructure. The adoption has been fantastic. We started by running our internal QA infrastructure and then scaled it out to our production infrastructure. We now manage 548 nodes (a combination of internal and production) via Puppet. </p>
<p>Using a project called <a href="www.fullybaked.co.uk/articles/getting-gource-running-on-osx">Gource</a>, one of our engineering leads, <a href="http://twitter.com/ryantomlinson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ryan Tomlinson</a>, created a video of the repository vizualization.

Two days out of ten, seems a lot doesn’t it?</p>
<h2 id="How-we-started"><a href="#How-we-started" class="headerlink" title="How we started"></a>How we started</h2><p>We started doing our 20% time when we had two week sprints with a release each sprint. We actually had three days of testing, small bug fixing and signing things off. We didn’t like starting our new stories for the next sprint as our QAs got behind and never really caught up. We decided to use this time more for clean-up but also for prototyping or trying something out. We had read of other companies doing something similar so were excited to give it a go. </p>
<p>One of the first times we did this we actually decided we wanted to automate all the testing of one of our systems, so that our QAs weren’t bogged down for those three days. In our first 20% time, we got most of the team on board as it was painful watching, let alone doing manual testing and we wanted faster feedback on our changes.</p>
<p>We got a lot of the system in a state we could test it. We basically wrote a lot of a page object model and a few features to talk to it. The next 20% time it needed cleaning up, the next we had a lot under test. With a bit of work the three day test cycle was down to about one day. This would never have happened if we were trying in normal sprint time. Major win number one and something no business owner had had to wrestle against other priorities.</p>
<p>After this instance we have had numerous similar examples, albeit on a smaller scale, where each team has been able to try things out, with no consequence in the event of failure, and achieved great prototypes. Much of our new architecture has been tested out in these sessions, new technologies, new approaches, can people work together?</p>
<h2 id="Failures-not-so-bad-after-all"><a href="#Failures-not-so-bad-after-all" class="headerlink" title="Failures, not so bad after all"></a>Failures, not so bad after all</h2><p>Of course, we have had many failures, but maybe even that helps, we won’t waste our proper sprint time. Some people ask me about rules when I talk about this. I think the key for me is that the engineers are truly given freedom to explore. If on the face of things something they are doing is completely away from what you are doing then it might seem a bit strange.</p>
<p>But what if they are looking to try something new and would have left your company to do so? What if they think it might be a solution but don’t know how to say? What if they can use it in nine months on an urgent project? All these things can and have happened.</p>

<h2 id="Know-your-student-find-their-style"><a href="#Know-your-student-find-their-style" class="headerlink" title="Know your student, find their style"></a>Know your student, find their style</h2><p>Let’s start with the science behind how we learn.</p>
<p>The first recognised attempt to identify different approaches individuals use in order to learn was David Kolb with the book ‘<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Experiential-Learning-Experience-Source-Development/dp/0132952610" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Experimental Learning</a>‘. Kolb suggested that humans have a range of learning techniques available to us and that we tend to lean on one learning style above all others.</p>
<p>In recent times his research has proved to be inaccurate - yes people have different learning styles, yes they  show an emphasis in one particular style but Kolb’s definition of separate styles was confused. </p>
<p>Enter <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_styles#Peter_Honey_and_Alan_Mumford.27s_model" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Honey and Mumford and their 1999 adaptation on Kolb’s model</a>. They identified four distinct learning styles which have since grown to be the preferred assessment of human learning styles. </p>

<p>The important thing to remember is not all individuals can be pigeon-holed into one group. These characteristics are evident across all industries and teams; I can certainly see myself and others in this list. Can you?</p>
<p>Now we can silo and identify behaviour, we can look deeper into the flow of learning.</p></div><a href="/blog/2014/02/03/coaching-style-over-substance/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2013/11/22/beginning-a-journey-to-chatops-with-hubot/"><h2 class="post-title">Beginning a journey to chatops with Hubot</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 22 November 2013 · <a href="/blog/categories/Hubot/" class="tag post-meta">Hubot</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Hipchat/" class="tag post-meta">Hipchat</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Chatops/" class="tag post-meta">Chatops</a></p><div class="post-entry"><img src="/images/posts/hubot_pug_me.png" class="center">
<p>As a part of our 30% time a few of our team, <a href="https://twitter.com/ajroyle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@ajroyle</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/stack72" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@stack72</a> and I (<a href="https://twitter.com/ryantomlinson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@ryantomlinson</a>) decided to get together and look at <a href="http://hubot.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hubot</a> with <a href="https://www.hipchat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hipchat</a> integration. There are several weird and wonderful scripts that ship with Hubot (see above) but the core concept of driving tooling via chat is one that we see value in.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-Chatops"><a href="#What-is-Chatops" class="headerlink" title="What is Chatops?"></a>What is Chatops?</h2><p><a href="https://speakerdeck.com/jnewland/chatops-at-github" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chatops</a> is a term coined by Github to describe their growing culture of “putting tools in the middle of the conversation”. But what does that exactly mean?</p>
<p>To move fast and maintain stability it’s important to have a culture of automation, measurement and sharing (<a href="http://www.opscode.com/blog/2010/07/16/what-devops-means-to-me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CAMS</a>). Tooling plays a key role in doing so and as your devops toolkit grows with the team there is an inherent learning and maintenance overhead. <a href="http://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github</a> made a move to centralise the conversation by driving everything they do into chat. By building tools and executing commands in a chat room that can be automated by a bot, communication doesn’t become an afterthought to operational processes but is core to how you operate. If I want to deploy code, I type a command into chat. If I want to take a server offline, I type a command into chat. If I want to merge a git pull request into master, I type in a command into chat, and so on. Communication is baked in.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-Hubot"><a href="#What-is-Hubot" class="headerlink" title="What is Hubot?"></a>What is Hubot?</h2><p>Hubot is a chat bot that sits in your chat room, listens for commands and executes them. It was written by Github in Coffeescript on Node.js and comes with a host of <a href="https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/tree/master/src/scripts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prewritten scripts</a> to get started with. Hubot also comes with a range of adaptors that allow it to plug-in to chat servers such as Campfire, IRC and Hipchat. We chose the latter.</p>
<h2 id="How-do-you-get-started"><a href="#How-do-you-get-started" class="headerlink" title="How do you get started?"></a>How do you get started?</h2><p>I won’t re-write the readme because the getting started section <a href="https://github.com/github/hubot/tree/master/docs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> says it all. Using the node package manager it’s so easy to get up and running with <a href="https://github.com/blog/968-say-hello-to-hubot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hubot</a>. So many other people have documented this process that I won’t attempt to rewrite their <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/writing-hubot-plugins-with-coffeescript/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">good</a> <a href="https://github.com/blog/968-say-hello-to-hubot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posts</a>.</p>

<h2 id="The-code"><a href="#The-code" class="headerlink" title="The code"></a>The code</h2><p>The meta data that we added to the site are an <em>application ID</em>, and what Microsoft have termed the <em>Package Family name</em>.

<h2 id="Finding-the-values"><a href="#Finding-the-values" class="headerlink" title="Finding the values"></a>Finding the values</h2><p>There are at least two ways of finding the values. If you have your application code and Visual Studio 2012 (or later) then the values can be found in the <strong>package.appxmanifest</strong> file &ndash; open this in VS and it automatically launches the manifest designer view.

This would allow me to deploy the application just once and then have different headers on the web server rather than regional variances. Whilst on a flight to San Francisco, I was able to hack together some code that allows just that. The details of that hackiness are below.</p>
<p>I started with a simple ASP.NET MVC application. I then created an area. The default area registration looks as follows:</p>

    public override void RegisterArea(AreaRegistrationContext context)
    {
        context.MapRoute(
            &quot;Domain_1_default&quot;,
            &quot;Domain1/{controller}/{action}/{id}&quot;,
            new { controller = &quot;Home&quot;, action = &quot;Index&quot;, id = UrlParameter.Optional },
            new[] { &quot;WebApplication.Controllers&quot; }
        );
    }

    public override string AreaName
    {
        get { return &quot;Domain1&quot;; }
    }
}
</code></pre><p>The name of the folder in my project corresponds to the AreaName as above. I have approximately six areas in the application that relate to different views. Now is where the hacky magic happens. I build the routing for the application myself. In my global.asax.cs, I have the following declaration:</p>
<pre><code>protected void Application_Start()
{
    AreaRegistration.RegisterAllAreas();

    //this is done using my IoC container
    var routingEngine = new RoutingEngineFactory();
    routingEngine.RoutingRegistration(RouteTable.Routes);
}
</code></pre><p>This is the creation of my RoutingEngine. This class is responsible for taking each area in the system in turn and then creating the routes for my application based on these. I am sure you are asking why I am doing that? The answer is simply that I can use a combination of MapRoute and IRouteConstraints to build a sufficient route for the URLs I need to map. The code looks as follows:</p>
<pre><code>public void RoutingRegistration(RouteCollection routes)
{
    var areaNames = GetAllAreasRegistered(routes);
    routes.IgnoreRoute(&quot;{resource}.axd/{*pathInfo}&quot;);
    routes.IgnoreRoute(&quot;{*favicon}&quot;, new { favicon = @&quot;(.*/)?favicon.ico(/.*)?&quot; });

    foreach (var area in areaNames.Select(Area.From))
    {
        RegisterDefaultRoute(area.Name, routes);
    }
}

private void RegisterDefaultRoute(string areaName, RouteCollection routes)
{
    var defaultRoute = routes.MapRoute(
            BuildRouteSegment(areaName, &quot;Default&quot;),
            &quot;{controller}/{action}/{id}&quot;,
            new { controller = &quot;Home&quot;, action = &quot;Index&quot;, id = UrlParameter.Optional },
            BuildUrlConstraint(areaName),
            new[] { DefaultControllerNameSpace }
            );
    defaultRoute.SetAreaDataTokens(areaName);
}
</code></pre><p>The code works in the following way:</p>
<p>Get a list of all the areas.<br>Add the Ignore routes as these are more specific and need to be at the top of the list.<br>To this list of areas, add a new area of name string.Empty. This will allow us to register the routes for the non area parts of the site. This is really hacky as denoted by the code above.<br>Foreach area in the list, register a route. This route has the same URL for all routes.<br>But how do we distinguish which of the routes match to a specific domain?</p>
<p>routes.MapRoute in MVC has a number of overloads. The overload we will be using has the following signature:</p></div><a href="/blog/2013/09/25/resolving-domains-to-areas-in-asp-dot-net-mvc/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2013/09/23/quick-look-at-rethinkdb/"><h2 class="post-title">Quick look at RethinkDB</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 23 September 2013 · <a href="/blog/categories/MongoDB/" class="tag post-meta">MongoDB</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/NoSQL/" class="tag post-meta">NoSQL</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/RethinkDB/" class="tag post-meta">RethinkDB</a></p><div class="post-entry"><p>Someone in the office mentioned <a href="http://www.rethinkdb.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RethinkDb</a> and I was impressed by the rhetoric on the site, so I decided to spend a couple of hours spiking one of our existing nodejs apps with RethinkDb.

<p>The api on the nodejs driver is pretty nice, it makes a concerted effort to reduce “pyramid code” by allowing you to build your query by method-chaining and then call a <code>.run()</code> extension to execute the query.</p>

<p>A major bugbear for us with mongoDb is that writes require a database-level lock.

<p>Counting is the religion of this generation it is its hope and its salvation.<br>Gertrude Stein</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In our NeverEnding quest to provide better experience to the users we utilise user behaviour logs to influence future results. One particular case is restaurant popularity, which is indicated by many factors, for example how often it is searched and viewed.</p>
<p>In this blog post we will look into multiple ways of counting documents in Elastic Search which is crucial for this kind of activity. All examples here are provided using Elastic Search HTTP interface and code examples implemented with <a href="https://github.com/Yegoroff/PlainElastic.Net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlainElastic.NET</a> are <a href="https://gist.github.com/gondar/6320578" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available here</a></p>
<p>Before we make a deep dive into Elastic Search Counting options let’s define our expectations:<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">So that I can order restaurants by those that are most searched</span><br><span class="line">As a potential diner</span><br><span class="line">I want the most searched statistics from the logs to be part of the search database</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>Okay, that’s not exactly how our story was defined but as we don’t want to discuss the whole search infrastructure here, let’s assume this is sufficient.</p>
<p>Because we are eager engineers, we will quickly build some mock data against which to test our assumptions. Our restaurant name search logs look something like this:<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">	&quot;RestaurantId&quot; : 2,</span><br><span class="line">	&quot;RestaurantName&quot; : &quot;Restaurant Brian&quot;,</span><br><span class="line">	&quot;DateTime&quot; : &quot;2013-08-16T15:13:47.4833748+01:00&quot;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>So we will populate our mock database with appropriate commands and check that all is in place:<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">curl http://localhost:9200/store/item/ -XPOST -d &apos;&#123;&quot;RestaurantId&quot;:2,&quot;RestaurantName&quot;:&quot;Restaurant Brian&quot;,&quot;DateTime&quot;:&quot;2013-08-16T15:13:47.4833748+01:00&quot;&#125;&apos;</span><br><span class="line">curl http://localhost:9200/store/item/ -XPOST -d &apos;&#123;&quot;RestaurantId&quot;:1,&quot;RestaurantName&quot;:&quot;Restaurant Cecil&quot;,&quot;DateTime&quot;:&quot;2013-08-16T15:13:47.4833748+01:00&quot;&#125;&apos;</span><br><span class="line">curl http://localhost:9200/store/item/ -XPOST -d &apos;&#123;&quot;RestaurantId&quot;:1,&quot;RestaurantName&quot;:&quot;Restaurant Cecil&quot;,&quot;DateTime&quot;:&quot;2013-08-16T15:13:47.4833748+01:00&quot;&#125;&apos;</span><br><span class="line">curl http://localhost:9200/store/item/_search?q=*\&amp;pretty</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>Our expected output is a count of documents for each restaurant. For example:<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">	&quot;Restaurant Brian&quot; : 1</span><br><span class="line">	&quot;Restaurant Cecil&quot; : 2</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p>There are three ways this can be achieved in Elastic Search; using count API (which seems like the most obvious way), a search with type set to count, or using facets to generate counts of all objects grouped by given property. Let’s compare them:</p>

Usually, this is very hard to achieve, in fact it took years for us to get to this point. <a href="/blog/2015/02/09/dismantling-the-monolith-microsites-at-opentable/">I described in a previous article</a> how we dismantled our monolith in favour of a Microsites architecture. Since the publication of that blog post we have been working on something I believe to be quite unique, called <strong>OpenComponents</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="Another-front-end-framework"><a href="#Another-front-end-framework" class="headerlink" title="Another front-end framework?"></a>Another front-end framework?</h3><p>OpenComponents is a system to facilitate code sharing, reduce dependencies, and easily approach new features and experiments from the back-end to the front-end. To achieve this, it is based on the concept of using services as interfaces - enabling pages to render partial content that is located, executed and deployed independently.</p>
<p>OpenComponents is not <em>another SPA JS framework</em>; it is a set of conventions, patterns and tools to develop and quickly deploy fragments of front-end. In this perspective, it plays nicely with any existing architecture and framework in terms of front-end and back-end. Its purpose is to <strong>serve as delivery mechanism for a more modularised end-result in the front-end</strong>.</p>
<p>OC is been in production for more than a year at OpenTable and it is <a href="https://github.com/opentable/oc" target="_blank" rel="external">fully open-sourced</a>.</p>

<p>We all know to have stable, reliable software you need to have well written tests. Facebook knows this and<br>provides the handy <em><a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/test-utils.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Test Utilities</a></em> library to make<br>our lives easier.</p>
<p>Cool — I hear you all say! But what is the best approach to testing React components?</p>
<p>Well unfortunately this is something that is not very well documented and if not approached in<br>the correct way can lead to brittle tests.</p>

<p>##What is Puppet-community<br>Puppet-community is a GitHub organisation of like-minded individuals from across the wider Puppet ecosystem and from a diverse set of companies.

A question that has popped out a lot, and when I say a lot I mean <em>always</em>, is:</p>
<p><em>Could you tell me what happens when I type an URL in a web browser on my computer and press enter?</em></p>
<p>Of course the possible answers could range from “MMMHHH, wellll, I’m not sure where to start…” to a whole book on computer networks.</p>
<p>After a number of attempts to answer briefly and correctly, I’ve concluded that mentioning <strong>DNS</strong> can make a reasonable start.</p>
<p>Let’s think about it. When we type the address of the resource we want to browse, we use the alphabet, right? With letters and names easily readable and retainable by a human being.</p></div><a href="/blog/2015/03/05/the-dns-abc/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2015/02/16/hapi-js-and-sigterm/"><h2 class="post-title">Hapi.js and SIGTERM</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 16 February 2015 · <a href="/blog/categories/Microservices/" class="tag post-meta">Microservices</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Hapi-js/" class="tag post-meta">Hapi.js</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/SIGTERM/" class="tag post-meta">SIGTERM</a></p><div class="post-entry"><p>When we first stood up our hapi.js APIs, we wrote init scripts to start/stop them. Stopping the server, was simply a case of sending SIGKILL (causing the app to immediately exit).</p>
<p>Whilst this is fine for most cases, if we want our apps to be good Linux citizens, then they should terminate gracefully. Hapi.js has the handy <code>server.stop(...)</code> command (see docs <a href="http://hapijs.com/api#serverstopoptions-callback" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>) which will terminate the server gracefully. It will cause the server to respond to new connections with a 503 (server unavailable), and wait for existing connections to terminate (up to some specified timeout), before stopping the server and allowing the node.js process to exit. Perfect.</p>
<p>This makes our graceful shutdown code really simple:</p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div><div class="line">2</div><div class="line">3</div><div class="line">4</div><div class="line">5</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">process.on(<span class="string">'SIGTERM'</span>, <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params"></span>)</span>&#123;</div><div class="line">  server.stop(&#123; <span class="attr">timeout</span>: <span class="number">5</span> * <span class="number">1000</span>&#125;, <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params"></span>)</span>&#123;</div><div class="line">    process.exit(<span class="number">0</span>);</div><div class="line">  &#125;);</div><div class="line">&#125;);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>When we see a SIGTERM, call <code>server.stop()</code>, then once the server has stopped, call <code>process.exit(0)</code>. Easy peasy.</p>

New teams were created with the goal of splitting up the logic that was powering the back-end and then bring to life new small services. Then, we started working on what we call <em>Microsites</em>.</p>
<h3 id="Microsites"><a href="#Microsites" class="headerlink" title="Microsites"></a>Microsites</h3><p>A microsite is a very small set of web-pages, or even a single one, that takes care of handling a very specific part of the system’s domain logic. Examples are the <em>Search Results</em> page or the <em>Restaurant’s Profile</em> page. Every microsite is an independently deployable unit of code, so it is easier to test, to deploy, and in consequence more resilient. Microsites are then all connected by a front-door service that handles the routing.</p>
<h3 id="Not-a-free-ride"><a href="#Not-a-free-ride" class="headerlink" title="Not a free ride"></a>Not a free ride</h3><p>When we deployed some microsites to production we immediately discovered a lot of pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bi-weekly deployments of the monolith became hundreds of deployments every week.</li>
<li>Not anymore a shared codebase for hundreds of engineers. Pull requests accepted, merged, and often deployed on the same day.</li>
<li>Teams experimenting and reiterating faster: product was happy.</li>
<li><em>Diversity</em> on tech stacks: teams were finally able to pick their own favourite web-stack, as soon as they were capable of deploying their code and taking care of it in terms of reliability and performance.</li>
<li>Robustness: when something was wrong with a microsite, everything else was fine.</li>

<h2 id="Introduction-to-REST"><a href="#Introduction-to-REST" class="headerlink" title="Introduction to REST"></a>Introduction to REST</h2><p>REST stands for Representational State Transfer, and it can be defined as an architectural style used to build Web Services that are lightweight, maintainable, and scalable. A service that is designed by REST principles can be called a <strong>RESTful service</strong>.</p>
<p>It has been described first in 2000 by Roy Fielding, in a <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/webarch_icse2000.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external">dissertation</a> called “Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures”. The basic idea was to describe the interactions between the components of a distributed system, putting constraints on them and emphasizing the importance of an uniform interface, that is abstracted from the single components.</p>
<p>REST is often applied to the design and development of web services, which is the scenario I’ll try to address in this post.</p>
</div><a href="/blog/2015/02/02/a-beginners-guide-to-rest-services/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2015/01/23/on-strongly-typed-logging/"><h2 class="post-title">On Strongly Typed Logging</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 23 January 2015 · <a href="/blog/categories/Architecture/" class="tag post-meta">Architecture</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/ElasticSearch/" class="tag post-meta">ElasticSearch</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Logs/" class="tag post-meta">Logs</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Kibana/" class="tag post-meta">Kibana</a></p><div class="post-entry"><p>Logging is a crucial element of monitoring highly available systems. It allows not only to find out about errors but also quickly identify their cause. Logs are often used to generate metrics that help business and engineering make informative decisions on future development directions. </p>
<p>At OpenTable we have a central logging infrastructure, that means all logs are stored in the same shared database (ElasticSearch for us). And everybody can access any logs they want without having very specialized knowledge (thanks Kibana!).</p>
<p>ElasticSearch, though living in a NoSQL world, is not actually a schema-free database. Sure, you do not need to provide schema to it but instead ES will infer schema for you from documents you send to it. This is very similar to type inference you can find in many programming languages. You do not need to specify type of field, but if you later on try to assign inappropriate value to it you will get an exception.</p>
<p>This trait of our database goes all the way to the root of our logging system design. Let me explain why I say that we have ‘strongly typed logs’.</p>
<h2 id="In-The-Beginning-There-Was-String"><a href="#In-The-Beginning-There-Was-String" class="headerlink" title="In The Beginning There Was String"></a>In The Beginning There Was String</h2><p>Before centralization we just logged a single message along with its importance. In code it looked something like:<br><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><div class="line">1</div></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">logger.ERROR(“Kaboom!”)</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p></div><a href="/blog/2015/01/23/on-strongly-typed-logging/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2015/01/19/building-a-living-styleguide-at-opentable/"><h2 class="post-title">Building a living styleguide at OpenTable</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 19 January 2015 · <a href="/blog/categories/UI/" class="tag post-meta">UI</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Design/" class="tag post-meta">Design</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/OpenTable/" class="tag post-meta">OpenTable</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/CSS/" class="tag post-meta">CSS</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Styleguide/" class="tag post-meta">Styleguide</a></p><div class="post-entry"><p>If you’re reading this you’ve probably built yourself a website.  A site - large or small - that’s thrown together or crafted over many months.  And if you have, you’ve probably kept all your CSS class names in your head, or at least been able to go straight to the relevant stylesheets to retrieve them.</p>
<p>Well OpenTable is unsurprisingly built by many engineering teams across multiple continents, and was completely redesigned last year.  And as soon as you have more than a handful of people working on your front-end you will quickly find a well-intentioned developer causing one or both of these problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Well-intentioned developer adds a new submission form but, like the design Philistine he is, his buttons are <span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:18px;color:#E40000;">18px Verdana #E40000</span>, not the correct <span style="font-family:arial;font-size:16px;color:#DA3743;">16px Arial #DA3743</span></li>
<li>Your good old developer knows which font size and colour it should be, but bungs a duplicate class into a random stylesheet (or worse still, inline)</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite these risks, a single front-end dev (or a team of them) cannot check every new piece of code or they will quickly become a bottleneck.</p>
<h3 id="You-need-some-guidelines"><a href="#You-need-some-guidelines" class="headerlink" title="You need some guidelines"></a>You need some guidelines</h3><p>Offline designers regularly create ‘brand guidelines’ or ‘design standards’ to document the precise way their brand or product should be recreated when outside of their control.  Online, such guidelines are similarly invaluable for maintaining brand and code consistency with multiple engineers and designers, but it is blindingly obvious that a printed or ‘static’ set of guidelines is completely unsuitable for a constantly changing website.</p></div><a href="/blog/2015/01/19/building-a-living-styleguide-at-opentable/" class="post-read-more">[Read More]</a></article><article class="post-preview"><a href="/blog/2015/01/01/explaining-flux-architecture-with-macgyver-dot-js/"><h2 class="post-title">Explaining Flux architecture with macgyver.js</h2></a><p class="post-meta">Posted on 1 January 2015 · <a href="/blog/categories/JavaScript/" class="tag post-meta">JavaScript</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Macgyver/" class="tag post-meta">Macgyver</a> · <a href="/blog/categories/Flux/" class="tag post-meta">Flux</a></p><div class="post-entry"><h2 id="What-is-Flux"><a href="#What-is-Flux" class="headerlink" title="What is Flux?"></a>What is Flux?</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/facebook/flux" target="_blank" rel="external">Flux</a> is an application architectural pattern developed by Facebook. It was developed to solve some of the complexities of the MVC pattern when used at scale by favouring a uni-directional approach. It is a pattern and not a technology or framework.</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/mvc-scale.png" alt="MVC scale issue"></p>
<p>When applications that use the model-view-controller (MVC) pattern at any scale it becomes difficult to maintain consistent data across multiple views. In particular the case whereby flow between models and views is not uni-directional and may require increasing logic to maintain parity between views when model data is updated. Facebook hit this issue several times and in particular with their unseen count (an incremented value of unseen messages which is updated by several UI chat components). It wasn’t until they realised that the MVC pattern accomodated the complexity that they stepped back from the problem and addressed the architecture.</p>
<p>Flux is intentionally unidirectional.</p>

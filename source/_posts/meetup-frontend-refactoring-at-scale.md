OpenTable is delighted to host the tenth WEBdeLDN monthly meetup with talks by [Jack Franklin](https://twitter.com/Jack_Franklin) (Frontend Engineer at Thread) and [Nick Balestra](https://twitter.com/nickbalestra) (Senior Engineer at OpenTable - Delivery Tools Team at OpenTable).

This month's WEBdeLDN talks will be about frontend refactoring at scale with two real use cases: refactoring a monolith frontend application, as well as migrating a large, business critical application from Angular 1 to React.
